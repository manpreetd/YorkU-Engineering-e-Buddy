                <p>If you are reading this and starting or completing your first year of Software Engineering, welcome aboard!
                    Your first year will contain classic and core engineering courses that are common across all engineering programs. 
                    The only difference though is that <strong>Software, Computer and Electrical Engineers</strong> have to take 
                    <strong>EECS 1028 </strong>, the rest <strong>(Mechanical, Civil and Space)</strong> will have to take
                    <strong>ESSE 1012</strong> in their first year.
                </p>
                <h3 class="arrow" onclick="toggleCourseContent('eng1101', this)"><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right arrow-icon"></i> ENG 1101 - Ethics, Communication & Problem Solving</h3>
                <p id="eng1101" class="course-content">
                    This will mark the beginning of your first ENG course, where you will learn about engineering ethics, case studies, communication, and problem solving. Extremely clear and direct course but rather takes up a lot of time.

                <p id="eecs1011" class="course-content">
                    This is going to be your initial programming course during your first year of college, utilizing a programming language similar to C that is commonly used by scientists and engineers,
                     known as MATLAB (derived from Matrix Laboratory). This course also presupposes that you have no previous programming experience.
                     You might need to purchase an Arduino Uno kit for the final assignment scheduled at the conclusion of the class. After completing this course,
                     I have not personally utilized MATLAB, and it is rare for software development positions to require proficiency in MATLAB. Depending on the instructor,
                     you might have the opportunity to utilize MATLAB in upcoming classes such as Signals and Systems. In the end, there's no need to worry about learning all of its syntax and features (I've forgotten everything about MATLAB).
                      However, if you are new to coding, I recommend learning basic coding concepts such as variables, scoping, loops, and more before delving into more advanced courses.

                    It's essentially a recap of high school calculus, but you might pick up some new concepts and ideas. If you have completed AP or IB calculus, the class shouldn't pose a challenge.

                    It's beneficial for those interested in pursuing careers in fields like Machine Learning or Computer Vision. This math class in your engineering program is considered 
                    less challenging compared to calculus, in my opinion.

                    Civil, and Space fields. There is also a lab portion where you will conduct experiments relevant to the course material that will impact your grade. Continue to work on physics problems consistently and view

                    This course in English will serve as your introductory design course. The course will cover engineering designs for problem-solving through drawings, frameworks, models, and aesthetics, as well as potential solutions for world or local problems in group projects. Ensure your attention is on designing for a technical issue, not a social issue. Similar to ENG1101, simple yet requiring a lot of time.

                    This will likely be your only chemistry course in the program. I found this course easier than my grade 12 chemistry class mainly because it doesn't include organic chemistry. Doing well in this course necessitates practicing and memorizing. You will conduct chemistry lab experiments on titration, polymers, equilibrium analysis, chemical reactions, ferrofluids, and other topics. One of the benefits of this course is that you can choose when to take it, as it is not required for any upcoming courses. If you want to take fewer classes in the second semester of your first year, consider choosing CHEM 1100 for now. Although it would be preferable to move on quickly, as the course may not be available every semester or you may have forgotten a lot of your high school chemistry.

                    This course is based on the same principles as EECS 1011, but will focus on teaching Java programming language and OOP principles, so make sure to take it seriously. Having a good understanding of Java syntax and object-oriented programming is important for upcoming programming and EECS courses. This course also enabled me to create my initial personal project utilizing the Arduino board and various Java libraries. Transitioning from just knowing MATLAB or Python, Java might pose some challenges due to its complexity. I came from a Python background, so I had to become familiar with Java's syntax.

You will delve into integral calculus by learning integration techniques, improper integrals, sequences and series, and power series. Review and understand course material through problem-solving to perform successfully, just like you did in MATH 1013.

                    As indicated by the course title, you will be studying E&M and optics. This physics course is essential for EECS Engineering students, laying the foundation for future courses like electrical circuits, digital logic design. In the labs, you will primarily utilize the breadboard and software like LabVIEW. Before this course, I had no experience using a breadboard, so I found it a little challenging to use. If your breadboard is not functioning properly after you have been experimenting with it for some time, make sure to ask your TAs for assistance to avoid wasting time in your lab. After comparing the content of this course with PHYS 1800, I discovered that it is slightly simpler and more engaging.

                    Allow me to present the most notorious class to every new EECS engineering student. The main challenge lies in the fact that it is unlike the computational or plug-and-play courses you have taken before. The topic is mathematical logic, particularly proofs that are often challenging for many students initially. To succeed, aim for a good teacher, collaborate with peers, grasp the ideas well, and put in a lot of practice. Ideally, attempt to complete this course before beginning your second year. I withdrew from the course during my second semester of freshman year, but later I enrolled in it again during the summer with a new teacher and managed to earn a respectable grade, which did not negatively impact my EECS GPA. It is an important class that necessitates writing proofs and understanding logic for courses such as EECS 2101 (Data Structures), which opens up opportunities for advanced courses and helps in preparing for coding interviews. Another challenge is the need to understand unique ideas taught in class materials that are not accessible for self-study online.

                    Nevertheless, we opted for the summer session and utilized a standard discrete mathematics textbook, rather than using unfamiliar course materials. Here is a good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-gb0E4MII28GykmtuBXNUNoej-vY5Rz"
