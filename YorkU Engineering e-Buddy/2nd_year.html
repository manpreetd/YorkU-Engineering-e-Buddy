                <p>Congrats on surviving first year! First year might have been a breeze for some people, but second year will definitely humble 
                   most people, as it happened to me. The majority of your classes will shared with Computer and Electrical Engineers, as they still
                   have some more core courses to do. This will be a bumpy year so buckle up!</p>

                <p id="eecs2030" class="course-content">
                    This course comes before EECS 1021. You will cover important OOP principles like inheritance, polymorphism, aggregation, and composition, as well as shallow copy, deep copy, interfaces, and abstract classes. It is recommended to take this course soon as it is a prerequisite for many 2nd year courses and beyond that build upon EECS 2030.

                <p id="eecs2101" class="course-content">
                    Formerly named EECS 2011, this course holds great significance and is my top choice in the second year. You will gain knowledge of various data structures required for coding interviews or online coding assessments (arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, hashmaps, heaps, trees and graphs), as well as understanding their optimal application in problem-solving. You will also briefly discuss algorithms such as sorting, tree traversal, and graph traversal. Djikstra's algorithm is a popular method for finding the shortest path in a graph. The course is fairly easy at the beginning, but becomes challenging once you reach the topic of trees and graphs. In my experience, EECS 2101 will certainly cover data structures, but seldom require their implementation in coding tasks (although this could vary with different instructors). I suggest practicing Leetcode problems focused on linked lists, heaps, trees, and graphs to enhance comprehension of these data structures. I seldom did proofs in the class either, but it could vary based on the professor, so it's advisable to review discrete math concepts too.

                <p id="eecs2021" class="course-content">
                    One of the courses I enjoyed most in my second year. Throughout this course, you will be educated on subjects that pertain to hardware including gates, memory, and various number systems like binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal, as well as cache and pipelining. You will gain knowledge in assembly programming, utilizing RISC-V and hardware description languages such as Verilog. Taking this course is essential if you are interested in exploring areas such as embedded systems, firmware design, FPGAs, etc. Keep in mind that this course requires a significant time commitment and I suggest allocating ample time for it. In third-year courses such as EECS 3201 and EECS 3216, Verilog will resurface with the assumption of no prior knowledge, so it is advisable to have a basic understanding of it. Knowledge of Verilog is crucial for Electrical and Computer Engineers, but less relevant for Software Engineers unless they intend to delve into hardware development.

                <p id="eecs2200" class="course-content">
                    I have never been happier than when I passed a course and knew I wouldn't have to retake it. This course focuses on examining and resolving electrical circuits, going further than the content covered in PHYS 1801. In my opinion, this course in sophomore year is the most challenging due to the requirement for an innovative strategy in addressing circuit issues. Before diving into math formulas and solving physics problems, it is important to comprehend the functioning of a circuit to effectively troubleshoot. In addition, you need to understand the fundamentals of circuits: how voltage, current, and resistance function, Kirchhoff's Laws, identifying if resistors are in series, parallel, or neither, etc. Fortunately, it is not required for most courses.

                    If you choose to pursue the General Stream, you can delay taking EECS 3452 until a later time. I discovered this course to have limited relevance for Software Engineers, however, it would still be necessary for our program to receive accreditation from the CEAB. I strongly suggest enrolling in this course during the summer if you have the time to quickly complete it.
                    Learning ahead for this course would also be a good idea, here is a good

                    The ultimate mathematics class. I discovered that this was much simpler than integral calculus due to the extensive connections between differential calculus, integral calculus, and linear algebra. Transitioning from MATH 1013 to MATH 1014 is harder compared to this. Nevertheless, a strong understanding of linear algebra learned in MATH 1025 is necessary for working in 3D or multiple dimensions.

                    Throughout the semester of this course, you will work in a group to create a software project using Java and the knowledge gained from EECS 2030. Ensure you locate a group that is enthusiastic about exceeding the minimum requirements. My suggestion is to learn Git and Github, as well as SQL databases, before starting this course, rather than waiting for them to be covered in class (this was a mistake I made). It includes typical and significant SWE methods in the field such as testing, code reviews, user stories, agile software development, and more. If I had known Git and databases earlier, my team could have improved our project with a well-structured GitHub repository, potentially earning a higher grade. Learning course content in advance, especially technologies crucial in the field of software engineering, is beneficial for future proficiency.

                    Picture EECS 1028 (or EECS 1019) as a packet of potato chips. Next, there is another bag of chips that has an unusual and distinct flavor (such as shrimp), which is MATH 1090. You will be introduced to boolean and first order logic in a different abstract syntax compared to EECS 1028. Remember that this course is exclusive to York University and other universities do not offer the same content, even if some professors mock it or dislike teaching it. Despite its seemingly irrelevant content, it is crucial to grasp the material in this course to succeed in third-year courses such as EECS 3342. In my opinion, it is simply a course that fills a gap for students in the fields of CE and CS. EECS 1028 is not required before taking MATH 1090. Nonetheless, EECS 1019, a course on discrete mathematics for computer science, is required before taking MATH 1090. I suggest starting with EECS 1028 so that MATH 1090 will be easier for you to understand.
