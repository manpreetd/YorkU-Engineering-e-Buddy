                <p id="stream" class="course-content">
                <strong>General: </strong>  Unlike in Big Data and Security, you get to pick three EECS courses
                of your choice (based on what your course checklist tells you), such as databases, 
                machine learning, networks, digital and mobile communications, computer vision, computer security, etc. Don't let
                the name fool you however, as there is a catch. You will have to take two other 
                (mostly irrelevant to SE) courses in return: Signals and Systems & Control Systems. 
                These courses are mostly applicable to niche subfields like communications, signal processing, etc. 
                General stream gets a bad reputation from these difficult and inapplicable courses, missing out on other cool EECS courses to take.
                In my honest opinion, I don't recommend pursuing this stream.
                <br/><br/>
                <strong>Big Data: </strong>  The flagship stream.
                In my opinion for long-term learning, I think this is the best stream to get into. You take
                some cool courses like machine learning, data mining, big data systems, etc. You also take courses like databases (EECS 3421), 
                which I think every developer should take. Heads up that these courses are also challenging and require
                prerequisites from difficult courses like EECS 3101.
                <br/><br/>
                <strong>Security: </strong> You take very specialized courses related to computer security such as networks, cryptography, forensics, computer security labs, etc.
                This stream may not have the best courses compared to Big Data, however this is the easiest stream if you want to graduate and get out
                or have commitments out of school. Don't limit your knowledge to just these courses if you want to get into cyber security, there are still many things to do and learn out there as well 
                (side projects, CTFs, penetration testing, etc).

                <p id="csvsse" class="course-content">
                <b>Software Engineering</b>: The SE program at YorkU is quite interesting. It's 
                worth noting that not many schools offer a BEng Software Engineering program,
                which is often overshadowed by CE and EE. Sometimes, it's not even an accredited
                program by the CEAB. For instance, the University of Guelph offers a "Bachelor of
                Computing" in SE and CS. Ultimately, it's very different from SE at York, plus
                most people resort to CS over SE at Guelph. When comparing to the SE and CE
                curriculum at York, there is heavy overlap in courses up to 3rd year. CE take
                more EE courses while SE in replacement take more SE (testing or project) courses.
                So the way I see it, SE is basically a streamlined software version of CE/EE. 
                Therefore, if you are interested in pursuing engineering (knowing
                you will have to take some EE and ENG courses) and in software 
                development, can't go wrong with SE. 
                <br></br>
                <b>Computer Engineering</b>: CE has a lot of balance with EE
                and CS courses, which is great if you don't know weather you want to work with hardware or software. 
                There are many people in CE who ended up working in the software industry though. So if your focus
                is working with software, I would reconsider studying CE, unless if you have some
                interest in EE or have no other options. Otherwise, CE is a fantastic choice.
                <br></br>

                <b>Computer Science</b>: CS at York offers courses that are more theoretical 
                and less practical than SE (with obviously way less EE courses). The huge 
                advantage CS has over SE and CE, is the lighter workload and huge flexibility.
                You have more time for stuff outside your lectures without taking harder engineering
                courses. I also have to mention CS is great to study if you intend to pursue
                grad school, having an easier time maintaining your GPA as well as research
                opportunities. Not only is it easier, there's less requirements and courses to do,
                and thus inexpensive. You have SE/CE which requires about 150 credits to graduate
                while in CS you need 120 credits to graduate (or 90 credits if you drop out of honours).  
                People often forget that CS is a broad field, so you can 
                work in many ares (with more time and flexibility of course) 
                such as web development, mobile development, embedded and hardware development, ML, AI, game development, etc.
                If an engineering title doesn't mean anything to you (like getting a P.Eng, 
                the iron ring, etc.) and want to secure more Software Engineering internships, CS would be the
                best here. 
                <br></br>
                One last thing to mention, although CS is clearly easier than engineering,
                engineering degrees are invaluable and can tell people that you are
                "smart" on paper. You have access to more jobs such as 
                project management, finance and more. Holding an engineering degree 
                will make travel visas much easier, since engineers are valuable 
                to any country.

                <h3 class="arrow" onclick="toggleCourseContent('elect', this)"><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right arrow-icon"></i>What electives can I take?</h3>
                <p id="elect" class="course-content">
                    Firstly, if you are in 1st or 2nd year, I wouldn't worry about electives/complementary studies yet, finish your core courses first. If you've seen your program
                    checklist, typically they'll usually state electives in 3rd or 4th year, so follow that (unless of course you need to raise your GPA or need a 2000-level
                    course for coop). 
              
                    <br></br> 
              
                    My general advice for taking electives is try taking courses that you may knowledgeable in or interested in taking, but also lighter compared to other courses you're taking.
                    At my time at York, the complementary Korean courses would fill up instantly. This is primarily because of: the huge popularity of Korean culture (K-Pop, K-Dramas, 
                    Korean Cuisine, etc.) in the West, plus they were mostly fully online or hybrid with good professors. Moreover, they are mostly a semester long (3 credits) unlike
                    other humanities/social science courses that are a year long (6 credits).
              
                    <br></br> 
                    
                    There also exists courses that are known to be extremely light, even if the course doesn't sound interesting to you (who knows, you might like the course when 
                    you finish it). I would be however skeptical about these courses, because course difficulty is subjective and may be outdated, especially from online
                    forums like Reddit or Discord and even face-to-face. For example, when I took Intro to Religion Studies, it was known to be an easy course, additionally
                    being fully online. However, some of my friends found it tedious (peep a 48-hour online exam) and the final course average isn't what you'd expect from an easy elective (~70%-73%).
                    Fast forward today to 2024, it's no longer considered an "easy" course. I however found it quite interesting and ended up with a pretty good grade.
                  
                    <br></br> 
              
                    So my rule of thumb for electives is: interest <span>&#8805;</span> difficulty!
                </p>
