                        We are UNHack Group 90 and we're currently studying Software/Computer Engineering and Computer Science at York University. We started the program in Fall 2022, and we're expecting to graduate by April 2026. The purpose of this project is to cover FAQs and advice from ourselves as a students, to prepare EECS Engineering students to be successful in their degree such as courses, roadmaps, etc. Other people from other universities (and here) have created guides and tools similar to mine, which has inspired us to do the same and deliver this to whoever needs this the most.
                    </p>

                        Engineering has a LOT of courses you will take, including courses specialized for us that other non-engineering students will probably never take. Thus, there isn't much information on what to expect in these engineering courses, other than the course code and name. This information is especially essential to know so you don't end up pairing difficult courses together. Even if you aren't in Software Engineering, I'm sure there is some things here to take away.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We want to add an important note that we're rating course difficulty based on <strong>how hard course content is grasped and workload.</strong> Professors run courses differently,
                        so it may be easier or harder in the past despite going through mostly the same course content, thus we won't be covering much of this.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We am hoping this to be a long-term project until we graduate, as we expand on more knowledge and advice I've accumulated over the years. Just a disclaimer, this is an <strong>unofficial guide</strong> by us, which is unaffiliated with York University. So expect the information here based on our own experiences ðŸ˜€.
